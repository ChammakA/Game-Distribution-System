# ExtremeXP Game Distribution System

Welcome to the ExtremeXP Game Distribution System, a course project developed for CSCI 3060U â€“ Winter 2024. This project is an implementation of a Digital Distribution Service for Games, adhering to the principles of Extreme Programming (XP) philosophy.

## Project Overview

The system comprises two integral parts:

1. **Front End (C++)**
   - A robust point-of-purchase terminal for buying and selling games.
   - Written in C++.
   
2. **Back End (Python/Java)**
   - An overnight batch processor to maintain and update a master games file.
   - Written in Python or Java (your choice).

## Key Features

- Continuous integration with frequent releases.
- Pair programming for all code.
- Automated testing and integration.
- Simplest possible solutions to every problem.
- Continuous redesign and re-architecting.

## Project Phases

1. **Front End Requirements** (Due: Feb 2, 2024)
2. **Front End Rapid Prototype** (Due: Feb 16, 2024)
3. **Front End Requirements Testing** (Due: Mar 1, 2024)
4. **Back End Rapid Prototype** (Due: Mar 15, 2024)
5. **Back End Unit Testing** (Due: Mar 28, 2024)
6. **Integration and Delivery** (Due: Apr 10, 2024)
