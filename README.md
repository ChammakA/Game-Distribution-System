# ExtremeXP Game Distribution System

Welcome to the ExtremeXP Game Distribution System. This project is to create a point-of-purchase terminal for simulating a game distribution system. It will contain two parts: the frontend and the backend. It will also be automated and tested using scripts and batch files.

## Project Overview

The system comprises two integral parts:

1. **Front End (C++)**
   - A robust point-of-purchase terminal for:
      - creating and deleting accounts.
      - buying and selling games.
      - adding and refunding credit.
      - logging and logginig out of sessions.
      - listing all available games and profiles (based on user level)
      - searching for users/games (based on user level)
   - Testing Scripts
   - Written in C++.
   
2. **Back End (Python/Java)**
   - An overnight batch processor to maintain and update a master games file.
   - Written in Python or Java (your choice).

## Key Features

- Continuous integration with frequent releases.
- Pair programming for all code.
- Automated testing and integration.
- Simplest possible solutions to every problem.
- Continuous redesign and re-architecting.

## Project Phases

1. **Front End Requirements** (Due: Feb 2, 2024)
2. **Front End Rapid Prototype** (Due: Feb 16, 2024)
3. **Front End Requirements Testing** (Due: Mar 1, 2024)
4. **Back End Rapid Prototype** (Due: Mar 15, 2024)
5. **Back End Unit Testing** (Due: Mar 28, 2024)
6. **Integration and Delivery** (Due: Apr 10, 2024)


## Requirements

- Front End: A console application in C++
- Back End: A console application in Python/Java
